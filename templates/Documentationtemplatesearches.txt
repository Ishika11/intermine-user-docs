Template Searches
===============




What is a template search
-----------------------------------


A template search is a pre-defined query that we have created for you. A template search allows you to search the database without having to construct your own query or understand the underlying data structure. A library of template searches covering the full range of data is available. 


Each template comes with a short name and longer description of nature of the search (for example, the description for Gene -> Pathway template is: show the Pathway identifier(s) and name for the selected gene). We provide a short name so you can quickly scan the available searches and find the one that you need while the longer description will provide you with more details and any limitations to the values you can enter.


Upon clicking the template, you will have to fill the variable value of the form you are seeking (from the previous example, the name of the gene and the organism). Default values are always provided so you can immediately run them and see if they return the data you require.


To access the template library click on the templates tab in the main menu bar.

Finding the template search that you want
--------------------------------------------------------


The list of template searches is long. To help you find the template search that you want you can filter the list using either keywords or data categories:

Can’t find what you want - please ask
--------------------------------------------------


If you can’t find a template search that you want or if there is one available but it doesn’t quite return everything you are after please :ref:`contact`.  Template searches can be created or modified and made available to you immediately, provided the data is available in the database. Use the **Contact us** form found on every InterMine page or email us at **support@flymine.org**.


Running a template search
------------------------------------


A template search provides you with a form, with one or more variables to set. Some will require you to enter a value, while others will provide drop-down lists for you to select from.
Some templates provide optional constraints. These constraints can be turned on or off as required. Once you are happy with your options, simply click **show results** to run the search.

How do I run a template search with one of my lists or a public list?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


First, **remember to log-in** so that your own lists can be viewed. Every template can be run on relevant :ref:`lists` of objects - if you have lists of the correct type (e.g. a list of genes) or if there is a suitable public list, you will be able to select the one you require from a drop-down list.  You need to select the checkbox to access this.

Understanding your results
------------------------------------


Your template will return a results table. Besides displaying your results, the table is a powerful analysis tool as well. See the :ref:`resultstables` for more details and information on how to save or download your results.

Modifying a template search
--------------------------------------


Sometimes you may find a template does not return everything you want in your results. Templates can also be a good starting point for building more complex searches. You can modify a template using the :ref:`querybuilder` - simply click on **Edit query** to display the template in the query builder. You need to understand how to use the query builder to modify your template - please see the :ref:`querybuilder` documentation. Remember, if you do not want to invest the time learning how to use the query builder you can :ref:`contact` the InterMine team who will be happy to help construct the search you require.

Building your own template search

TroubleShooting
----------------------


My template returns no results - why?


All templates should return results with the default values provided (please :ref:`contact` if you find one that doesn’t). If you have provided your own values, in most cases it will mean we don’t have the data you are looking for. In some cases, however, particularly for more complicated searches with optional constraints, it may be because of the way the search is constructed - some of the required data may be there but not all of it, resulting in no results. If you have activated multiple optional constraints, it is often a good idea to turn these on individually to see if one in particular is causing the problem.  By default adding a constraint means that the data MUST satisfy that constraint for the search to return results - see :ref:`outerjoin` for more details.  Please :ref:`contact` if you require further assistance.
