General Overview
==============


The InterMine query interface provides a variety of ways in which you can view and analyse data, whether you are looking at a single gene, a list of over 1000 genes, transcription factor binding sites or protein interactions. To understand the interface it is useful to understand the following terminology:


Intermine allows you to work with **single items (objects)** and **multiple items (lists)**:


**Object:** A single item in the database. For example a gene, a protein or a binding site.


**List:** Multiple items of the same type. For example a list of genes or a list proteins.


InterMine has four search tools:




* :ref:`quicksearch` : A simple search box for looking up names, identifiers or keywords for genes, pathways, authors, etc.


* :ref:`templatesearches` : A list of pre defined queries along with descriptions of what the queries do. It lets you search the required template, select it and fill in the variables (or select from a dropdown) of the various forms relevant to the query (example, chromosome, gene, organism, etc).


* :ref:`querybuilder` : An advanced query building tool - you can use this to construct your own searches or template searches.


* :ref:`regionsearch`: A tool for looking at genomic regions and the features they contain. It allows you to upload a set of regions and search for features mapped to these regions.


To view data resulting from these searches, intermine provides the following interfaces:


*   :ref:`reportpages`


*   :ref:`listanalysispage` 


*   :ref:`resultstables`


*   :ref:`regionsearchresults`






How everything links together:


Although the above tools and interfaces are described separately here, they do of course all interact with each other in various ways. For example you can run :ref:`templatesearches` to find all genes regulated by a specific transcription factor. From the resulting table you can :ref:`listupload` of these regulated genes. This list can then be analysed using the :ref:`listanalysispage` or used as input to run further :ref:`templatesearches`.


Alternatively, you can start by :ref:`listupload` of genes. Through the graphs and tables provided on the :ref:`listanalysispage`, you can filter this set according to some criteria (example, expressed in the brain) to create a smaller list and run a series of :ref:`templatesearches` or build your own queries using :ref:`querybuilder` to find out more about this set of genes. You can also browse the information available on the :ref:`reportpages` for those genes that look most interesting.


You can start by entering a gene identifier for a gene you have picked up in an experiment into the :ref:`quicksearch` box and browse all the information for this gene on its :ref:`reportpages`. From here you may for example, learn that this gene has orthologues in fish, mouse and rat. If you click the link for the mouse orthologue, you are directed to the report page for this orthologous gene in the relevant intermine, MouseMine.  


A set of worked use-cases is available in the :doc:`cookbook </cookbook/index>`.
